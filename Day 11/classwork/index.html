<p>Here, in fact, the writer talks about all the topics that a truth-seeker might be interested in. It is important that Dostoevsky was not able to finish it completely and left many questions unanswered. Hermann Hesse said: "It is fortunate that Dostoevsky did not finish The Brothers Karamazov." The finished work would blow up both Russian literature and the whole of Russia and humanity. But even what has been said, even if it is not said to the end, you cannot erase it, you cannot make it unsaid."</p>
<h7>1984</h7>

<p>Orwell's "1984" is really such a work that can show a person his weakness and put a terrible truth in front of him. The striving for freedom of a person caught in the grips of a totalitarian system especially drags the reader. Throughout the work, you wait for the main character to achieve his goal. In the end, you will discover a very painful fact.</p>
